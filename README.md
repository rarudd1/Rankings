# Rankings

This program gives a student's rankings based on their scores. 

The problem uses a dense ranking system. So if the class scores are 100, 90, 90, 85, 80, 70. They are ranked 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

The program takes a list of integers for the class scores ( in decending order) and then a second list of integers for the 
student scores (in ascending order). 

It then finds and prints the students ranking for each score. 

So for example if you have class scores of 100, 90, 90, 83, 80, 60 

and you are given student scores of 50, 80, 95, 100, and 120. 

It will print the students rankins of: 6, 4, 2, 1, 1
